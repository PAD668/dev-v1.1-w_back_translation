However, a modern Lutheran scholarship has found a different reality in Luther. Rather, Luther seeks to distinguish between faith and reason in order to honor the spheres of knowledge to which everyone applies. For example, Bernhard Lohse, in his classic book Fides und Ratio, showed that Luther finally tried to combine these two. Recently, Hans-Peter Grosshans has shown that Luther\u2019s Biblical criticism highlights the need for external consistency in the correct executable method. This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality that does not belong to the scriptures than that the Bible is reasonable to itself that it has internal unity. For Luther, the right tool to understand the world outside the Bible is only reason, which is an area of science, philosophy, history, and empirical observation for him.

Unlike the gentle approach taken by the European Court of Justice, the Committee of Experts stated that culture had evolved in such a way that few Commissioners had 'a low sense of responsibility'. This led to the establishment of a European Anti-Fraud Office. In 2012, it investigated the Maltese Health Commissioner, John Dalli, who resigned quickly after claiming to have received a EUR 60 million bribe under the Tobacco Products Directive. In addition to the Commission, the European Central Bank has a relative autonomy in the conduct of monetary policy for the management of the euro. It has a board of six appointed by the European Council on a recommendation from the Council.

According to Articles 9 and 10 of the Treaty on European Union, the EU follows the \"principle of equality of its citizens\" and is intended to be based on \"representative democracy\". In practice, equality and democracy are inadequate, because elected representatives of Parliament cannot legislate against the will of the Commission, the citizens of the smaller countries have ten times the power to vote in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and the legislation requires a 'quantity majority' or unanimity in the Council. As a justification for this 'democratic deficit' under the Treaties, it is generally considered that the full integration of the European economy and political institutions requires technical coordination of experts, while the people's perception of the EU has developed and nationalistic feelings have decreased since the war. Over time, this has meant that Parliament has gradually adopted more votes: it has been an unelected Assembly, its first direct elections in 1979, and it has gained more and more rights in the legislative process. The rights of citizens are therefore limited in comparison with the democratic policies of all EU Member States: Article 11 TEU states that citizens and associations have rights, such as their making their views public, and they present an initiative that the Commission must consider with a million signatures. Article 227 TFEU provides for a new right for citizens to petition Parliament in matters relating to them. Parliamentary elections shall take place every five years and the votes of the Members of the European Parliament shall be held in the Member States by means of a proportional representation or one transferable vote. There are 750 Members of the European Parliament and their number is 'less comparable' according to the size of the Member State. This means that, although the Council is to be a body representing the Member States, citizens of smaller Member States will have more votes in Parliament than citizens of larger Member States. Members of the European Parliament are divided, as they do in national parliaments, in party politics: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the European Social Democratic Party is leading the opposition. The parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice stated in the Parti \u00e9cologise \"Les Verts\" v Parliament, that this was a matter entirely regulated by the Member States. Parliament's powers include investigating maladministration or appointing an ombudsman to wait for trial. It may require the Commission to answer questions and, by a two-thirds majority, it may put a motion of censure to the Commission as a whole (as it did the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, Parliament has clear rights of consultation, which the Commission really must respect. However, its role in the legislative process is still limited because no Member can, in fact, adopt legislation without the Commission and the Council, which means that power (\"cracy\") is not in the hands of the direct elected representatives of the people (\"dems\"): it is not yet true in the EU that \"government is in the hands of many or few\".", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 81, "text": "the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union"}, {"answer_start": 81, "text": "the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union"}, {"answer_start": 81, "text": "the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union"}, {"answer_start": 81, "text": "the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union"}], "question": "Which two governing bodies have legislative veto power?", "id": "572651f9f1498d1400e8dbee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1753, "text": "every five years"}, {"answer_start": 1753, "text": "every five years"}, {"answer_start": 1753, "text": "every five years"}, {"answer_start": 1753, "text": "every five years"}], "question": "How often do Parliament elections take place?", "id": "572651f9f1498d1400e8dbf0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2854, "text": "two-thirds majority"}, {"answer_start": 2852, "text": "a two-thirds majority"}, {"answer_start": 2852, "text": "a two-thirds majority"}, {"answer_start": 2852, "text": "a two-thirds majority"}], "question": "How much of a voting majority must there be to effectively censure the Commission?", "id": "572651f9f1498d1400e8dbf1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 9, "text": "the Commission"}, {"answer_start": 9, "text": "the Commission"}, {"answer_start": 9, "text": "the Commission"}, {"answer_start": 9, "text": "the Commission"}], "question": "Which entity has a monopoly on initiating legislation?", "id": "5726938af1498d1400e8e446"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 81, "text": "the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union"}, {"answer_start": 81, "text": "the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union"}, {"answer_start": 81, "text": "the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union"}, {"answer_start": 81, "text": "the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union"}], "question": "Which entities have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process?", "id": "5726938af1498d1400e8e447"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1220, "text": "1979"}, {"answer_start": 1220, "text": "1979"}, {"answer_start": 1220, "text": "1979"}, {"answer_start": 1220, "text": "1979"}], "question": "When did the first direct elections take place?", "id": "5726938af1498d1400e8e448"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1753, "text": "every five years"}, {"answer_start": 1753, "text": "every five years"}, {"answer_start": -1, "text": "every five years,"}, {"answer_start": 1753, "text": "every five years"}], "question": "How often do Parliament elections take place?", "id": "5726938af1498d1400e8e449"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2356, "text": "the conservative European People's Party"}, {"answer_start": 2373, "text": "European People's Party"}, {"answer_start": 2373, "text": "European People's Party"}, {"answer_start": 2373, "text": "European People's Party"}], "question": "Which party is currently the largest among political party lines?", "id": "5726938af1498d1400e8e44a"}]}, {"context": "The second main legislative body is the Council, composed of the various ministers of the Member States.

This has led both the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the highest national courts to develop principles for resolving conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the Union, the Court of Justice considers that where EU law is incompatible with national law, EU law is a priority. In the first significant case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and Costa, a former shareholder of the energy company, refused to pay their electricity bill to Enel as a protest against the nationalisation of Italian energy companies. He claimed that the Italian nationalisation law was incompatible with the Treaty of Rome and requested that it be referred to both the Italian Constitutional Court and Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Italian Constitutional Court held that, since the Law on Nationalisation was from 1962 and the Convention was in force from 1958, Costa had no requirements. Instead, the Court held that, ultimately, the Treaty of Rome did not in any way prevent the nationalisation of energy and, in any event, according to the provisions of the Treaty, only the Commission could have made a claim, not Costa. However, Costa was in principle entitled to plead that the agreement was incompatible with national law and the Court should take into account his claim to lodge an appeal if its decision is not contested. The Court reiterated its view at Van Gend en Loos and stated that the Member States 'although in limited areas they have limited their sovereign rights and created a set of laws applicable both to their citizens and to themselves' on the basis of reciprocity. EU legislation \"would not be exceeded by national provisions, even if they were formulated... without calling into question the Community legal basis\". This meant that the Member State's 'following unilateral action' was not in force. Similarly, Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA claimed in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA that the public health inspection fee for imports of beef from France to Italy under the Italian Law of 1970 was contrary to two regulations for the years 1964 and 1968. In accordance with the principle of primacy of Community law, the Court stated that 'the measures directly applicable to the institutions (such as the relevant regulations) 'do not automatically apply the provisions of existing national law'. This was necessary in order to prevent Member States from \"refusaling unconditionally and irrevocably\" the obligations of the Treaty which could \"infringe\" the foundations of the EU.

However, this would only happen if citizens clearly wanted to leave the EU. In Case R (Factortame Ltd) the Minister for Transport stated that 'any limitation of Parliament's sovereignty, whatever it accepted in adopting the 1972 European Community law, was entirely voluntary' and therefore 'it has always been clear' that the UK courts are obliged 'to go beyond all national legal rules which have been found to be incompatible with the rules directly implemented by Community law'.

A Member State cannot 'apply to individuals in the manner in which it has failed to fulfil its obligations under the Directive'. Secondly, a citizen or an undertaking may rely on the Directive, not only in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company.

Signalson and Securitel, the Court held that a company called CIA Security could defend itself against competitors\u2019 claims that it had failed to comply with the Belgian regulation on alert systems since 1991 because it had not been notified to the Commission as required by the Directive. Thirdly, if the directive reflects the 'general principle' of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-governmental parties before the deadline for its implementation. This is the result of the judgment of K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci v Swedennx GmbH & Co KG, in which Article 622 of the German Civil Code states that the working years of persons under the age of 25 are not counted against the increasing legal dismissal before dismissal. K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci worked for Swedennx GmbH & Co KG for 10 years at the age of 18-28 before his dismissal. He claimed that a law that is not counted under 25 is illegal age discrimination under the framework directive on equal opportunities in working life. The Court considered that he could rely on the Directive because equality is also a general principle of EU law.

According to the standard theory of the comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less profitable economy in all respects. Like other regional organisations, such as the North American Free Trade Association or the World Trade Organisation, the dismantling of trade barriers and the free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, consumer prices are to be reduced. It was originally a theory that the free trade area tends to give way to a customs union which led to a common market, then to monetary union, then to a monetary and fiscal union, a political union, and ultimately to a full federation typical of a federal state. In Europe, however, these stages were very confusing and it is not clear whether the 'end game' should be the same as a country that has traditionally been understood. In practice, free trade without standards in order to ensure fair trade may benefit some people and groups in countries (particularly large companies) far more than others, but it puts a strain on people who do not have bargaining power in growing markets, particularly workers, consumers, small businesses, emerging industries and communities. Articles 28 to 37 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union establish the principle of the free movement of goods within the EU, while Articles 45 to 66 require the free movement of persons, services and capital. These so-called four freedoms were thought to prevent physical barriers (e.g. customs), technical barriers (e.g. different laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and tax obstacles (e.g. different VAT rates). The tension of the law is that free movement and trade are not intended to flow into a licence that justifies unlimited commercial profit. The Treaties restrict free trade and give priority to other values, such as public health, consumer protection, workers' rights, fair competition and the improvement of the environment.

In the most famous case, Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Brantwein, the Court ruled that the German law requiring all alcoholic beverages and liqueurs (not only imported) to have an alcoholic strength of at least 25 % is contrary to Article 34 of the TFEU because it has a greater negative impact on imports. German liqueurs were more than 25 % alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wanted to import from France, was only 15-20 % alcohol. The Court rejected the arguments of the German Government that the measure would be proportionate to protect public health under Article 36 TFEU, since stronger drinks were available and sufficient labelling would be sufficient for consumers to understand what they were buying. This rule applies primarily to the requirements relating to the content or packaging of the product. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA, the Court ruled that the Belgian law requiring all margarines to be in cubic packages infringed Article 34 and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians believe that it is butter if it is not shaped into cubes was disproportionate: it would 'extremely exceed the requirements of the subject' and labelling would protect consumers 'as effectively'. In 2003, the Commission v Italy required Italian legislation that cocoa products containing other vegetable fats should not be labelled as \u2018success products\u2019. It must have been \"chocolate.\" All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter only, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed that the law violated Article 34. The Court held that the low level of vegetable fat does not justify chocolate substitute labelling. This was demeaning in the eyes of consumers. \"A neutral and objective statement was enough to protect consumers. Where Member States impose significant barriers to the use of a product, they may also infringe Article 34. In its 2009 case, the Court of Justice held, in the Commission v Italy, that the Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds from towing trailers infringed Article 34. The law was again applied impartially to everyone, but it had a disproportionate impact on importers because Italian companies did not produce trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court concluded that a ban would prevent people from buying it: it would have 'a significant impact on consumer behaviour', which would 'have an impact on the market access of the product concerned'.

In Keck and Mithouard, two importers claimed that under the French competition law their charges, which prevented them from selling Pico beer at wholesale prices, were unlawful. The objective of the law was to prevent the throat surgery competition, not to prevent trade. The Court held that 'under the law and in fact' it was an equally appropriate'sales arrangement' (not an arrangement which alters the content of a product) which was not covered by Article 34 and therefore did not have to be justified. Sales arrangements can be considered to have an unequal effect in the case of 'in fact', particularly when traders in another Member State attempt to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In the case of Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini, the Court examined the Swedish prohibitions on advertising to children under 12 years of age and misleading advertisements on skin care products. Although the prohibitions have remained (as a legitimate or mandatory requirement under Article 36), the Court stressed that full marketing bans may be disproportionate if advertising is \"the only effective form of promotion enabling [the trader] to enter the market\". In the case of Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB, the Court ruled that the advertising of alcohol on radio, television and magazines could be prohibited in full in Article 34, where advertising was the only way for sellers to gain the \"traditional social practices and local customs and customs\" of consumers, but the national courts again decide whether it is justified under Article 36 in order to protect public health. According to the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU has harmonised restrictions on marketing and advertising in order to prohibit behaviour which distorts the behaviour of average consumers is misleading or aggressive and to list examples that are considered unfair.

Freedom of movement was increasingly based on 'citizenship', so people had the right to give them the opportunity to become economically and socially active instead of being a prerequisite for economic activity. This means that the fundamental rights of the \"worker\" of Article 45 TFEU are a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in Articles 18 to 21 TFEU. According to the Court of Justice, 'worker' is anyone who is economically active, including all those who are employed, under the guidance of another person, 'for compensation'. However, you do not have to pay for work in cash if you are protected as an employee. For example, in Steymann v Staatsexpertaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right of residence in the Netherlands when he volunteered for the plumbing and domestic work of the Bhagwan Community, which provided for the material needs of all, regardless of their contribution. The Court held that Mr Steymann had the right to remain, provided that at least an 'indirect countermeasure' was obtained for the work he had done. The status of \"employer\" means protection against all forms of discrimination by the government and employers in access to employment, taxation and social security rights. On the other hand, a citizen who is \"all citizens of a Member State\" (Article 20(1) TFEU) has the right to seek employment, to vote in municipal elections and in elections to the European Parliament, but a more limited right to claim social security. In practice, freedom of movement has become politically controversial when nationalistic political parties have manipulated fears that immigrants are taking people's jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time). Nevertheless, in practice \"all available studies show that labour mobility has little impact on the salaries and employment of local workers\".", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 180, "text": "the European Community"}, {"answer_start": 180, "text": "the European Community"}, {"answer_start": 180, "text": "the European Community"}], "question": "Which entity focused upon the free movement of workers?", "id": "5726baf2dd62a815002e8e75"}]}, {"context": "Articles 1 to 7 on the free movement of workers set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers. Firstly, Articles 1 to 4 generally require workers to be able to enter into employment, to enter into contracts and not to be discriminated against against against nationals of a Member State. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v. Bosman, Belgian footballer Jean-Marc Bosman, argued that he should be able to move from R.F.C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque at the end of the contract, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the normal transfer fees. The Court held that 'transfer rules constitute an obstacle to free movement' and that they are unlawful unless they can be justified in the public interest, but this is unlikely. In Groener v Minister of Education, the Court accepted that the requirement to teach Gaelics at the Dublin Model School could be justified as part of a general practice promoting Irish but only if the measure is not disproportionate. On the other hand, Angonese v. Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA, the Italian bank in Bolzano, was not allowed to claim from Angones a bilingual certificate available only from Bolzano. With its \"horizontal\" direct effect on Article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court justified that people from other countries would have little chance of obtaining a certificate and that \"it is impossible to provide evidence of the required language skills in any other way\", the measure was disproportionate. Secondly, Article 7(2) requires equal treatment in taxation. In the Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker judgment, the Court held that it was contrary to Article 45 TFEU to deny tax advantages (e.g. married couples and social security allowances) to a man who worked in Germany who lived in Belgium when other Germans received benefits. By contrast, in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg, the Court rejected Weigel\u2019s claim that the re-registration charge on his car brought into Austria infringed his right of free movement. Although the tax had a 'probable negative impact on migrant workers's decision to exercise their right to free movement' since the levy applied equally to Austrians because there was no EU legislation on this issue, it had to be considered justified. Thirdly, people must be treated equally with regard to'social interests', even though the conditions of residence have been approved by the Court of Justice. In his judgment in Hendrix v Workers' Insurance Institution, the Court held that the Dutch national was not entitled to continue invalidity benefits when he moved to Belgium because the benefit was 'closely linked to the Dutch socio-economic situation'. On the other hand, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, the Court held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands who works in Germany between 3 and 14 hours a week is not entitled to German child supplements, even if the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but lived in Austria could have. The general justification for restricting freedom of movement in Article 45(3) TFEU is 'public order, public security or public health', and Article 45(4) also contains a general exception to 'employment in public services'.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 2872, "text": "between 3 and 14 hours a week"}, {"answer_start": 2880, "text": "3 and 14 hours a week"}, {"answer_start": 2872, "text": "between 3 and 14 hours a week"}], "question": "In the case Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, how many hours was the Dutch woman in question working in Germany?", "id": "5726bc1add62a815002e8eaa"}]}, {"context": "The Court of Justice has increasingly regarded EU citizenship as a 'basic status' for nationals of Member States and has therefore increased the number of social services that people can use wherever they move.

In Gebhard v Consiglio dell\u00f3rdine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano, the Court held that \"stability and continuity\" means \"stability and continuity\" in economic life, whereas \"services\" meant \"temporary\" activity. This meant that Mr Stuttgart's lawyer, who had established a Chamber in Milan and had been condemned by the Milan Bar Council for not registering, had the right to claim freedom of establishment or freedom of service. However, requirements which must be registered in Milan before they can carry out their activities shall be allowed if they are not discriminatory, justified by \"overriding requirements of the general interest\" and applied proportionately. Any person or entity engaged in an economic activity, in particular self-employed persons or \"enterprises\", such as undertakings or undertakings, has the right to set up a business without unjustified restrictions. The Court held that both the government of a Member State and the private party could prevent the freedom of establishment, so Article 49 had both a vertical and a horizontal direct effect. In Reyners v Belgium, the Court held that it was unjustified to refuse to include a lawyer in a Belgian bar because he lacked Belgian nationality. Article 49 TFEU states that States are exempt from the infringement of the freedom of establishment of others when they exercise \"official authority\", but this was not the work of a lawyer (as opposed to the work of a court). By contrast, in the Commission v Italy, the Court held that the requirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with the maximum tariffs, unless an agreement has been concluded with the customer, is not a restriction. The Grand Chamber of the Court held that the Commission had not demonstrated that this had a purpose or an effect which would restrict the access of professionals to the market.

His Liber servitoris is particularly interesting because it provides a reader with recipes and explains how to prepare \"simplifications\", which were combined with then commonly used complex drugs.

Al-Biruni (973-1050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works in pharmacology, called Kitab al-Saydalah (Book on Drugs), in which he described in detail the properties of medicines and presented the role of the pharmacy and the tasks and duties of the pharmacy. Avicenna also described 700 medicinal products, their properties, procedures and indications. In fact, he devoted an entire amount to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. In addition, Baghdad and Cairo al-Maridin and Ibn al-Wafid (1008-1074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appeared as De Medicinis universalbus et specificus as a younger Mesue and Medicamentis simplecibus 'Abenguefit'.

Colonialism is seen to be an architect who decides how to begin to control the territories, and then imperialism can be seen as creating an idea behind colonial co-operation. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins to conquer the territory and is finally able to control the territories ruled by the previous nation. The central meaning of colonial power is to exploit the valuable property and supplies of the conquered nation and to make the conquering nation benefit from the spoils of war. The purpose of imperialism is to create an empire by conquering the countries of another country and thereby increasing its own power.

Opponents of the alleged aggressive and haughty imperialist policy of British Prime Minister Benjamin Disrael originally brought the term 'imperialism' to English in the late 1870s. Soon, supporters of imperialism, such as Joseph Chamberlain, caught it. To some, imperialism showed politics of idealism and goodwill, to others political selfishness, and more and more linked it to capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic mindset to the term. Lenin, in particular, had a significant influence on the later Marxist imperialist concepts of Imperialism, the highest stage of capitalism. Lenin described imperialism in his article as a natural extension of capitalism, which arose from the need for capitalist economies to continuously expand investment, material resources and labour in a way that required the expansion of the colonial region. Later Marxist theorists echo this notion of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism. Many theorists on the left have followed the structural or systemic nature of imperialism. Such writers have extended the term-related era so that it does not now mean politics or a short space of decades at the end of the 19th century, but a world system that extends centuries away and often returns to Christopher Columbus and, in some cases, to the Crusades. Once the use of the term has expanded, its significance has shifted to five distinct but often parallel axes: morality, economy, system, culture and time.
